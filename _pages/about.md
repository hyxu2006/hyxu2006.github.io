I am a Research Scientist at Core AI, [Meta Reality Labs](https://about.meta.com/realitylabs/?utm_source=about.facebook.com&utm_medium=redirect)
, where I build multimodal spatial vision systems for scalable video and world understanding. My research focuses on developing spatial intelligence models that integrate vision, language, motion, and geometry to enable robust perception, reasoning, and generation across modalities. Representative work includes [VideoAutoThink](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05175) (CVPR 2026), [VLM-3R](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.06974) (CVPR 2026 and Best Workshop Paper at ACM Multimedia 2025), and [MV-DUSt3R+]((https://github.com/facebookresearch/mvdust3r)) (CVPR 2025 Oral). In addition to research, I work on the on-device perception stack powering Meta Quest experiences, including semantic segmentation and real-time MR/VR spatial understanding. 

Before joining Meta Reality Labs, I was a technical lead and senior machine learning/computer vision engineer with the Video Engineering Group at Apple Inc. I have lead the algorithm development and delivered the shipments of multiple groundbreaking products, includes [Room Tracking](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2024/10100/?time=150) on VisionPro, [RoomPlan Enhancement](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2023/10192/) and [RoomPlan](https://developer.apple.com/augmented-reality/roomplan/). Additionally, I collaborated with Apple AIML on 3D Scene Style Generation, where we pioneered [RoomDreamer](https://machinelearning.apple.com/research/roomdreamer), the first paper to enable text-driven 3D indoor scene synthesis with coherent geometry and texture.

I received my Ph.D. and M.S. degree from University of Maryland, College Park, where I was advised by [Prof. Rama Chellappa](https://engineering.jhu.edu/faculty/rama-chellappa/). I completed my B.S. degree in Electrical Engineering and Information Science from [University of Science and Technology of China](http://en.ustc.edu.cn/). Additionally, I completed internships at Snap Research and the Palo Alto Research Center.
