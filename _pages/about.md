I am a Research Scientist at [Meta Reality Labs](https://about.meta.com/realitylabs/?utm_source=about.facebook.com&utm_medium=redirect). My work focuses on developing advanced on-device solutions to enhance the perception stack for Meta's MR/VR product lines. Additionally, I conduct fundamental research on 3D generative AI.

Prior to joining Meta Reality Labs, I was a technical lead and senior machine learning/computer vision engineer with the Video Engineering Group at Apple Inc. During my tenure at Apple, I have lead the algorithm development and delivered the shipments of multiple groundbreaking products, includes [Room Tracking](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2024/10100/?time=150) on VisionPro, [RoomPlan Enhancement](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2023/10192/) and [RoomPlan](https://developer.apple.com/augmented-reality/roomplan/). Additionally, I collaborated with Apple AIML on 3D Scene Style Generation, where we pioneered [RoomDreamer](https://machinelearning.apple.com/research/roomdreamer), the first paper to enable text-driven 3D indoor scene synthesis with coherent geometry and texture.

I received my Ph.D. and M.S. degree from University of Maryland, College Park, where I was advised by [Prof. Rama Chellappa](https://engineering.jhu.edu/faculty/rama-chellappa/). I completed my B.S. degree in Electrical Engineering and Information Science from [University of Science and Technology of China](http://en.ustc.edu.cn/). Additionally, I completed internships at Snap Research and the Palo Alto Research Center. 

# Product Highlights
* Jun, 2024. [Room Tracking](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2024/10100/?time=150) on [VisionPro](https://www.apple.com/apple-vision-pro/) is unveiled at Apple WWDC 2024. This technology identifies room boundaries, supports precisely-aligned geometries, and recognizes transitions between rooms.
* Jun, 2023. [RoomPlan Enhancement](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2023/10192/) is introduced at Apple WWDC 2023. It added numerous powerful features to RoomPlan, including multi-room scanning, multi-room layout, object attributes, polygon walls, improved furniture representation, room-type identification, and floor-shape recognition.
* Jun, 2022. [RoomPlan](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2022/10127/) is first released at Apple WWDC 2022. Combining the power of Apple LiDAR, state-of-the-art 3D machine learning, and an intuitive scanning UI, RoomPlan empowers developers to create innovative solutions in interior design, architecture, real estate, and e-commerce.
