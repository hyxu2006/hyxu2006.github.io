Welcome to Hongyu Xu's Homepage!        

I am a senior machine learning/computer vision engineer working on Apple AR/VR - [RoomPlan](https://developer.apple.com/augmented-reality/roomplan/), from Video Engineering Group, Apple Inc. RoomPlan is a new Swift API that uses the camera and LiDAR Scanner on iPhone and iPad to create a 3D floor plan of a room, including dimensions and types of furniture. 

I obtained my Ph.D. from University of Maryland, College Park and was advised by [Prof. Rama Chellappa](https://engineering.jhu.edu/faculty/rama-chellappa/). Over my Ph.D. years, I have worked on a variety of topics such as generic object detection, image/video face recognition/verification, domain adaptation, dictionary learning and sparse representation. I did one internship at [PARC-Xerox (Palo Alto Research Center)](https://www.parc.com/) and two at [Snap Research](https://www.snap.com/en-US/). I received my M.S. degree from University of Maryland and B.S. degree in Electrical Engineering and Information Science from [University of Science and Technology of China](http://en.ustc.edu.cn/).
